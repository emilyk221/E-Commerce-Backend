  ## Description
  This backend application uses object relational mapping technique, specifically sequelize, to create API endpoints to read, create, update, and delete product related data from a database of products from an e-commerce company. The ecommerce datatbase has tables containing categories, products, and tags. Categories can have many products and a product has only one category, forming a one-to-many association between the category and product tables. Products can have many tags and tags can have many products, forming a many-to-many association between the product and tag tables. Using different combinations of routes and endpoints, a user can read all categories, products, and tags and read a specific category, product, and tag. A user can also create, edit, and delete a category, product, and tag. This application forms the backend of an ecommerce website. The database can be populated with any retail company's products with API endpoints ready to display information on a customer-facing website.
